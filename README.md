# Duma_Elections_2016
A Python 3.5 app with GUI for downloading electoral data on parliamentary elections in Russia of 18.09.2016. You can choose the region and electoral system (FPTP or PR). Requires packages "bs4" and "requests". The file to run is gui.py , others are imported from gui.py

Descriptives.py is separate from the rest; run it if you need to aggregate the data on the regional level (take-home vote, turnout, share of votes for the major parties) once you get the raw data (only for PR system).
